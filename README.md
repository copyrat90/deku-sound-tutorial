## Sound on the Gameboy Advance

This is a mirror of Deku's Game Boy Advance sound mixer tutorial, which is currently hosted at https://deku.gbadev.org/program/sound1.html.

The main reason for the mirror is that the examples don't compile on my setup, and I wanted to fix them all up. ATM this is a work in progress.

I also want to tweak the site presentation to my preferences, mainly white text on a black background.

I wrote Deku an email to ask for permission to mirror the site, and he was very happy to grant it. He also stated his preference for a public domain license, so this whole repo is now covered by a CC0 license.
